# Creating a dashboard using Cognos Analytics

Building out a dashboard to allow to understand sales and service departments for a chain of car dealerships using Cognos Analytics

The following KPI metrics are visualized:

1. Sales dashboard, following KPI metrics:

* In the first small rectangle, Profit captured (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
* In the second small rectangle, Quantity sold captured
* In the third small rectangle, Quantity sold by model captured (as a bar chart)
* In the fourth small rectangle, Average quantity sold captured

2. Sales dashboard in the large rectangle, 'Profit' is displayed by 'Dealer ID' as a column chart, sorted in ascending order.

3. Service dashboard, following KPI metrics:
* In the top left area, the number of recalls per model of car captured (as a column chart)
* In the top right area, the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews captured (as a treemap)
* In the bottom left area, the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit captured (as a line and column chart).
* In the bottom right area, the number of recalls by model and affected system captured (as a heat map). This helped us understand if there are any outliers for a given model or a specific system.
